<h2>Some of my favorite movies</h2>

<hr />

<h3>Interestellar</h3>
<p>
   Science fiction movie where we can see how a real black hole
   looks like in a real mathematical way. Definetely a must watch
   from Christopher Nolan.
</p>
<p>
   "We've always defined ourselves by the ability to
   overcome the impossible"<br />
   - Copper
</p>

<h3>Shrek</h3>
<p>
   A must watch to enjoy with the family. A comical movie with really
   funny moments about a parody of your favorite fantasy old school
   movies.
</p>
<p>
   "This is the part where you run away"<br />
   - Shrek
</p>

<h3>Inglorious Bastards</h3>
<p>
   Packed with action and blood, this action movie will keep you
   on the edge of you seat. See the story of the most famous
   nazi killing gang that terrorized Germany.

   "Say 'Auf Wiedersehen' to your Nazi balls"<br />
   - Hugo Stiglitz
