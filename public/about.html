<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is William and i want to become a FullStack Engineer so i can jump from my Manual Tester job to a better paying Developer job.
  But this is not all, my final goal is to eventually become an indie game developer and to have my own litte studio.
</p>

<p>I love cats, music (deathmetal and synthwave) and i really like to workout. I want to be someone on this world, not to be famous or
  rich but to make a change.
